## üñ• Project Description

This project is about solving networking problems to make a network run. There are 10 levels available for training. For each level, a non-functioning network diagram appears. At the top of the window, there will be a goal to achieve: the issues to solve so that the network runs properly.

- Understand IP Addressing: Learn how IP addresses, subnet masks, and CIDR notation define networks and hosts.
- Configure Subnets: Divide large networks into smaller subnets to efficiently allocate IP addresses.
- Work with Routers & Switches: Understand their roles in directing network traffic and connecting devices.
- Set up Routing Tables: Define paths for data packets between networks using next-hop addresses.
- By the end of this project, you‚Äôll have a practical understanding of TCP/IP networking and the ability to troubleshoot and configure basic network setups.


## üåê Solving the Project
### 1. Understanding the Interface:
- NetPractice is a browser-based training platform. Each level presents a broken network diagram that must be configured to meet specific goals.

### 2. Solving Levels:
- Configure devices (routers, switches, and hosts) by assigning appropriate IP addresses and subnet masks.
- Adjust routing tables to ensure data packets flow correctly between networks.
- Use logs to troubleshoot and verify configurations.
  
### 3. Progressive Learning:
- The project consists of 10 levels, each introducing new challenges:
  - Level 1-3: Focus on basic IP addressing and subnetting.
  - Level 4-6: Introduce routing concepts and connecting multiple networks.
  - Level 7-10: Combine subnetting, routing, and advanced concepts like overlapping ranges and internet connections.

### 4. Simulating Real Networks:
- While the networks in NetPractice are virtual, the configurations mimic real-world scenarios, making it an ideal tool for learning and practicing networking fundamentals.
