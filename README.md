## ðŸ–¥ Project Description

This project is about solving networking problems to make a network run. There are 10 levels available for training. For each level, a non-functioning network diagram appears. At the top of the window, there will be a goal to achieve: the issues to solve so that the network runs properly.

- Understand IP Addressing: Learn how IP addresses, subnet masks, and CIDR notation define networks and hosts.
- Configure Subnets: Divide large networks into smaller subnets to efficiently allocate IP addresses.
- Work with Routers & Switches: Understand their roles in directing network traffic and connecting devices.
- Set up Routing Tables: Define paths for data packets between networks using next-hop addresses.
- By the end of this project, youâ€™ll have a practical understanding of TCP/IP networking and the ability to troubleshoot and configure basic network setups.
